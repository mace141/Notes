## Why Design Matters?

Design vs UX vs UI

UI and design play into UX. 

## Design Principles

Emphasis
 - Part of the design that catches the viewer's attention
 - Make one part stand out more with contrast

Movement
 - The path the viewer's eye takes through the work
 - Movement can be directed along lines, shapes, color, etc.

Pattern
 - The repetition of an object or symbol

Balance
 - Distribution of the visual weight of objects, colors, texture, & space

Proportion
 - The feeling of unity created when all parts (sizes, amounts, or number) relate
 well with each other

Variety
 - The use of several elements of design to hold the viewer's attention and to
 guide the viewer through the site

Rhythm
 - Created when one or more elements of design are used repeatedly to create a
 feeling of organized movement

Unity
 - The feeling of harmony between all parts of the work

## Colors

There are studied colors that go well together. 
 - coolors.co is a good site to generate a color palette
